The Drawbridge picoprocess is a lightweight, secure isolation container. It is built from an OS process address space, but with all traditional OS services removed. The application binary interface (ABI) between code running in the picoprocess and the OS follows the design patterns of hardware VMs; it consists of a closed set of 45 downcalls with fixed semantics that provide a stateless interface. All ABI calls are serviced by the security monitor, which plays a role similar to the hypervisor or VM monitor in traditional hardware VM designs.

The VMM is the software component that hosts guest virtual
machines. In fact, the VMM is often referred to as the host and the virtual
machines as guests. The VMM is a software layer that abstracts the physical
resources for use by the virtual machines. Because the VMM provides an abstraction,
it can run multiple virtual machines on the same system.
