The Drawbridge picoprocess is a lightweight, secure isolation container. It is built from an OS process address space, but with all traditional OS services removed. The application binary interface (ABI) between code running in the picoprocess and the OS follows the design patterns of hardware VMs; it consists of a closed set of 45 downcalls with fixed semantics that provide a stateless interface. All ABI calls are serviced by the security monitor, which plays a role similar to the hypervisor or VM monitor in traditional hardware VM designs.
